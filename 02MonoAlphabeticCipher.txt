CHAPTER 1 - DOWN THE RABBIT HOLE: ALICE IS BORED SITTING ON THE
RIVERBANK WITH HER SISTER, SHE NOTICES A TALKING, CLOTHED WHITE
RABBIT WITH A POCKET WATCH RUN PAST. SHE FOLLOWS IT DOWN A RABBIT HOLE
SUDDENLY SHE FALLS A LONG NAY TO A CURIOUS HALL WITH MANY LOCKED
DOORS OF ALL SIZES. SHE FINDS A SMALL KEY TO A DOOR TOO SNALL FOR HER TO
FIT, BUT THROUGH HICH SHE SEES AN ATTRACTIVE GARDEN. SHE THEN DISCOVERS
A BOTTLE LABELLED 'DRINK ME', THE CONTENTS OF 1-081CH CAUSE HER TO SHRINK
TOO SMALL TO REACH THE KEY. A CAKE WITH 'EAT ME' ON IT CAUSES HER TO
GROW TO SUCH A TREMENDOUS SIZE HER HEAD HITS THE CEILING.
